# JDBC-Projects

This repository contains a collection of my **JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)** projects, which showcase my ability to interact with various databases using Java. Each project demonstrates different aspects of database management, such as establishing connections, executing queries, and managing transactions using JDBC. The projects integrate with **MySQL** using real-world use cases like management systems and file handling (BLOB).
