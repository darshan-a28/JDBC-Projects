# JDBC-Projects

This repository contains a collection of my **JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)** projects, which showcase my ability to interact with various databases using Java. Each project demonstrates different aspects of database management, such as establishing connections, executing queries, and managing transactions using JDBC. The projects involve integrating with MySQL and other databases.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run any of these projects, you will need:
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- MySQL or another relational database management system (RDBMS) for the database.
- A MySQL client (like MySQL Workbench or command-line tools) to execute SQL scripts.
- Ensure your database connection credentials (host, username, password) are correctly set in the Java files.

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
